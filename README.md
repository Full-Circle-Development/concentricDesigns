Focus on the Q&amp;A Module of a previous front end project by setting up an API with enpoints and information that the frontend client is expecting.

## About
I have completed a frontend e-commmerce site prior to this and this project is setting up the backend to feed the client side information. I added up to 10 million records to the previous data that was supplied so I can see how the database will perform. When testing with New Relic and K6 I was able to get all queries in the 30ms range with 1, 10, 100, and 1000 RPS. AWS was used for two EC2 instances for the server and the PostgreSQL database.
